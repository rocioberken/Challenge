# Rocio Berken Challenge

Hello!
I converted the entire layout to responsive html using only css (scss), I didn't create a menu or notification panel as the instructions didn't say anything about using javascript. I focused on being faithful to the design, so I looked for a more similar font and didn't use the one provided.

Thanks for your time!
